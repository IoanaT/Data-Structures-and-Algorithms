/**
 * Given a string, we want to cut it into pieces such that each piece is a palindrome.
 * Write a function to return the minimum number of cuts needed.
 *
 * Ex1. Input: "abdbca"
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: Palindrome pieces are "a", "bdb", "c", "a".
 *
 * Ex2. Input: = "cddpd"
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: Palindrome pieces are "c", "d", "dpd".
